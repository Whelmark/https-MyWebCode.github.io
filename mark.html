Deku has been trying his best to keep fighting while steadily getting more worn out and tired, and thus it's begun to change him on the outside just as much as he's changed on the inside. It's resulted in a dark new look in the latest episode that makes Deku a frightening visage of the form hero he used to be: </p>

Luffy is the protagonist of Eiichiro Oda's One Piece and he set out to sea with the aim of becoming the Pirate King in a time known as the Great Pirate Era. With the power of a Devil Fruit known as the Gomu Gomu no Mi, Luffy became a rubber man and has, on his journey, grown tremendously powerful. With time, Luffy has taken his abilities to the next level by inventing what he calls "gears."
                                                                During the Enies Lobby arc, Luffy invented his Gear Second and Gear Third. Following the two-year timeskip, Luffy came up with the idea of Gear Fourth with multiple forms. While all these power-ups were incredible and enabled him to take on some of the most powerful people on the seas, he didn't truly hit his peak until the Wano Country arc. In the fight against Kaido, Luffy finally tapped into what is his strongest transformation of all time and supposedly him at his peak – Gear 5.</p>

                                                        </a>
                                                        <p>Satoru is a very tall man with a lean build in his later twenties who is considered relatively attractive, mainly due to his facial features. He has snow-white hair and the Six Eyes, which are a vibrant blue color. Satoru normally covers his eyes with a black blindfold which props up his hair and gives it a spikier appearance. When sporting a more casual look, Satoru will wear sunglasses and let his hair down to reach the base of his neck.
                                                            While working, Satoru wears a dark blue zip-up jacket with a high collar that's also fairly wide. He wears slim-fit matching black pants and black dress boots. Before switching over to a simple blindfold, Satoru used to wear bandages over his eyes. Satoru enjoys wearing expensive clothing[5] and has a number of casual looks he'll pair with wearing his sunglasses. As a Tokyo Jujutsu High student, Satoru wore the normal school uniform with his sunglasses before adopting any sort of makeshift blindfold.</p>

                                                    </a>
                                                    <p>Yuta uses Rika to secure his friends and tries to move to a safe area as several of Suguru's curses chase them. The rumbling of the pursuit shakes the school grounds, eventually breaking through a building as Yuta and Rika evade into the air. Suguru begins this fight with a large quantity of weaker curses before showing his more powerful ones as a way to test the Queen of Curses ability. Yuta and Rika move to a safer area where he heals his friends wounds with a reverse cursed technique.[2]
                                                        Suguru is impressed with Yuta's ability to heal so he allows him to go through with it. When Yuta finishes saving his friends, he asks why Suguru stopped attacking. The curse user adds that the distraction gives him time and asks them to continue. Yuta decides to use a cursed tool Rika can summon that has the Inumaki Family sigil. Using the megaphone Yuta commands all Suguru's centipede-like curses to die, instantly detonating them all on command. Suguru is impressed at Rika's sheer amount of boundless cursed energy can be shaped into any technique, making him want her more and more.</p>

                                                <p>Saitama (サイタマ, Saitama) is the main protagonist of the series and the titular One-Punch Man. He is currently the most powerful being to exist in the series. Saitama faces a self-imposed existential crisis, as he is now too powerful to gain any thrill from battle.[7]
                                                    Initially just a hero for fun,[8] Saitama later registers to be a professional hero for the Hero Association[9] upon realizing that nobody recognizes him as a hero, and defends his home in Z-City from monsters, villains, and other threats.[10] Under the Hero Association, he is assigned the hero name Caped Baldy (ハゲマント, Hagemanto; Viz: Bald Cape)[11] and is currently A-Class Rank 39.</p>
